2. Special levels - These vary in layout, buffers and locked columns. They come around every 7 levels.

3. Hard levels - The same as Normal levels (including variant after level 160), but all blocks under the surface are hidden. Occur every 9 levels.

4. Easy levels - These can be hard, normal or special, but are always a few difficulty levels below your current difficulty level. They start occurring from level 150, and come around every 13 levels.

5. Scrambled levels - These are normal levels, but someone has already done some moves towards solving them! The start occurring from level 180, and Occur every 9 levels, mostly just after a hard level.

6. Dungeon levels - These levels have enemies and traps. Use the proper items to remove them to continue your sorting journey!
